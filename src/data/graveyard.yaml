  Some things are not meant to last. Time changes many things, including tool preferences.

  Sometimes you dont need a particular tool anymore. Sometimes you find something that does the same job - but better.

  Its still nice to look back from time to time and remember your old friends. This section lists all the tools that I used to use. May they rest in peace.
